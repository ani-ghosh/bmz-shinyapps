We have developed a simple interface based on R-shiny to explore the output of LPJ-GUESS model simulation. The interface provides information on three items related to this exercise. The first tab provides background information on the project, modeling process designed to understand how large-scale adoption of improved crop management practices, geographies, and input dataset description. The second tab on map provides the users option to explore the spatial maps spanned across Ethiopia and Kenya. The user has the option to select the management practices and examine the impact of that management practices on keys outputs such as soil organic carbon, nitrogen flux, leaching and yield. The spatial outputs are available at 10 min grid cells and summarized for the period between 2020 and 2049 corresponding to GCM period 2030. Users also have options to download summary tables, maps and original modeling output. The last option is the cost benefit analysis (CBA). In the absence of actual data required for rigorous CBA analysis, we provide an option to include relative increase in cost associated with conservation agriculture practices and how much benefit in yield that can return over the time horizon of analysis, discount and exchange rate.
